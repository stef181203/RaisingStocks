# RaisingStocks

RaisingStocks is a complete web application built using Spring Boot for the backend, with Bootstrap for styling and JavaScript for front-end interactivity. The application includes a Java-based web scraper that populates the database with stock dataâ€”this scraper is an integral part of the overall project.

The main functionality of the application is to allow users to browse and analyze stock prices of Macedonian companies, with over 10 years of historical data available. It features 10 technical indicators designed to provide signals for buying, selling, or holding stocks, helping users make more informed decisions.

To complement the tabular data, each stock has an associated graph that visually represents price fluctuations over time, enhancing the user's understanding of market trends.

As this is the final version of the project, you can explore the full development history and team contributions in the GitHub repository linked below:
